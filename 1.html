  <p> Before we can begin to write serious program in C, it would be intresting to find out what really is C, how it came into existence and how does it copmpare with other programminfg languages. In this chapter, we would briefly outline these issues.<br>
  			Four important aspects of any language are- the way it stores data, the way it operates upon this data, how it accomplishes input and output, and how it lets you control the sequence of execution of instructions in a program. We would discuss the first three of these building blocks in this chapter.  </p>
